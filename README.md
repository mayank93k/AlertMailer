# Email Alert System in Scala

## Overview
    This Scala-based Email Alert System is designed to send alert emails based on specific conditions. 
    It loads email configurations from jobConfig.conf, constructs an email using JavaMail, and sends it through an SMTP server. 
    After successfully sending an email, it clears the stored alert messages.

## Features
    Stores alert messages using AlertMessage.
    Processes and sends alert emails via EmailAlertParser.
    Uses JavaMail API for email communication.  
    Loads SMTP configurations dynamically from jobConfig.conf.
    Supports logging for debugging and monitoring.

## Installation & Setup
#### Prerequisites
    Scala 2.12+
    sbt (Scala Build Tool)  
    JavaMail API (javax.mail)
    Configuration file jobConfig.conf
#### Step 1: Clone the Repository
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/email-alert-system.git
    cd email-alert-system
#### Step 2: Configure SMTP Settings
    Modify resources/jobConfig.conf with your SMTP server details:
    targetMail = "recipient@example.com"
    hostAddress = "smtp.example.com"
    port = "587"
#### Step 3: Build & Run the Application
    sbt compile
    sbt run

## Usage
1. Add an Alert Message

AlertMessage.addMessage("System is down!")

2. Process Alerts and Send Email

AlertProcessor("System Monitor")
